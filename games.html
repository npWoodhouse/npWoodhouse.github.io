                <p>Discarded was the first game I finished. I made it in 2023 during my freshman year at Boise State.
                  Making this project was super enjoyable and challenging. When I started this project, I knew that one
                  day I would like to make a 2D fighting game, so I used this project to work my way up to one. Once
                  work started on the project, I knew our timeline was fairly tight. Because of this I chose to focus on
                  one strong mechanic. Looking back on my inspirations I knew I wanted to make a player with motion
                  inputs.</p>

                <p>With my idea set I had to figure out how I was actually going to make the game. After several nights
                  of brainstorming and testing I created an admittedly quite hefty character movement script that read
                  the direction a player inputs. That input is stored as a number in an array that the jump function
                  would read. </p>

                <p>I learned a lot making this project. I learned how to approach problems in a way that solutions were
                  achievable in code. I also learned how to manage my ideas so that my goals were achievable within an
                  allotted time period.</p>

                <p>This Game was a 3D dungeon generator that I made over Christmas break in 2024. I had very little
                  experience in 3D at this point, so I kept my geometry simple. For this project I made a wave function
                  collapse algorithm to create the random pools found on the floor. I also made a dungeon handler that
                  could determine the number of floors and what aesthetic those floors could have, although I never made
                  any other tile sets.</p>

                <p>Additionally, this was the first self-guided project of this scale that I had worked on so I had to
                  manage myself and my time to finish this project in the roughly two-week window I had. </p>

                <p>Peaceful potions was a game jam project I worked on with some of my friends. It was made in 48 hours,
                  and it was hectic but a ton of fun. This was my first ever game jam and it concluded on January 20th,
                  2025. For the jam I created all of the items and level assets and offered help when our other artist
                  was making the characters, it was their first time working in pixel art, so I gave some pointers. </p>

                <p>Only having 48 hours to make a game pushed our team to an extreme version of measuring deliverables,
                  brainstorming, and team coordination. Although the project was stressful, we divided our work well and
                  made a game that held up well in spite of its short development.</p>
